As its name implies, a "Hamburger" was originally a German dish that originated in Hamburg (and has nothing to do with ham, in spite of modern derivatives such as "chicken-burger" and "Veg-burger"). Its repackaging as the most popular type of fast food was however an American achievement, as America was the first nation in the world to master modern methods of large scale food production, distribution and conservation (notably deep freezing). Other forms of fast food were common all over the world too; the "packed lunch", some bread and something to eat with it.
