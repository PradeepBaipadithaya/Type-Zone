Navigation on the river was (and still is) frequently dangerous. Mudbanks and sandbanks could shift rapidly, and water levels rise and fall. In many places, pilots were necessary to guide boats past difficult sections. All kinds of boats could be seen on the river. The great passenger boats of the 19th century were magnificently decorated, like floating palaces with all the luxuries that first-class passengers could wish for; but other more ordinary boats carried a mix of passengers and cargo. There were the legendary "Showboats" too, floating cabarets, music halls and theatres.
