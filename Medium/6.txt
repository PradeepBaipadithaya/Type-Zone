 Beside Highway 51, just south of the city is Graceland; this is the house which Elvis bought after he became a star, and which he kept till the day he died. Today it belongs to his daughter Lisa Marie, but is run as an Elvis Presley museum: it is the second most visited house in the U.S.A., after the White House. The people who work at Graceland seem to be some of Elvis's biggest fans. They live and breathe Elvis! In the café, there is day-long Elvis on the music system; and as visitors are taken round Graceland, their guides talk about Elvis as if he were more than the King — more like the God of rock 'n' roll.
