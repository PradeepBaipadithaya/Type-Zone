For a poor boy brought up in a two-room shack in rural Mississippi, it probably was fairly good style. Elvis's tastes were brash, rather like those of many other ordinary unsophisticated folk. He liked the good things in life: girls, guitars and Cadillacs â€” and he sang about them regularly. That was one of the reasons why he became such a star. The other reason was, of course, that Elvis really was a good artist, and he really did change the face of American popular music. Before Elvis, the only real rock 'n' roll singers were black, and their style was not quite the same as that of Elvis.
